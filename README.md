# Disease_Prediction_Model
A collection of Machine Learning models for predicting multiple diseases — including Heart Disease, Lung Cancer, Parkinson’s Disease, and Thyroid Disorders — built using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and basic deployment using app.py.

# 📌 Features
✔ Multi-disease prediction models
✔ Separate Jupyter Notebooks for each disease
✔ Clean ML pipeline using standard libraries
✔ Easy to extend (add more diseases or models)
✔ Simple Python app (app.py) for running predictions
